WORK SAMPLE FOR FRONT END WEB DEV POSITIONS

As of November 1st, 2016, the web page created by the accompanying documents can be viewed at:

http://www.lmci.state.tx.us/researchers/dashboard/PublicEd/Public_Ed_2011_12/pedash1112.asp

These files were written by me, but are techncially property of TWC. I copied with permission, and explicitly for the purpose of demonstrating my past work product. 

Note to the reader:

I assembled these scripts and documents in a work environment with zero developer support for my position. I worked for the Texas Workforce Commission as a policy researcher and the TWC does not classify that role as a technical position. Therefore I was not allowed to install any executables or command-line utilities except for a very narrow range of pre-approved software, and exceptions required a lengthy bureaucratic process that my unit preferred to avoid. 

I wrote and tested the HTML and CSS entirely in Notepad++ and Google Chrome. The underlying data was compiled locally in Excel, tested in R-Studio, and converted to a Google Charts friendly format via Python scripts run through online interpreters. 

This page is not only ADA Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 compliant, it is considerably more compliant than Google Charts comes out of the box. The entire page is navigable as keyboard-only or mouse-only, every tool is ARIA-compliant to allow manipulation by screen reader programs, all fonts are accessibly designed and sized, all images except the banner splash were converted to SVG for clarity and scalability, both key and mouse navigation are highlighted by CSS3 illustrations. I also learned about several undocumented fields in the Google Vizualization API and exploited these to make the bar chart use different colors and sort with the data table.

Please note that the current set of online dashboards have not been maintained by me since January 2016, and I cannot vouch that they have been maintained properly. 

Please also note that since this page was published I've become considerably better versed in Javascript and have gained some hands-on experience with web developer tools unavailable at TWC such as Django and Selenium, though not as a work duty. 

Thank you for reading,

James
